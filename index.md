# MetaScope 

## What is MetaScope?

MetaScope is a complete R-based 16S, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic profiling package that can accurately identify the composition of microbes at a strain-level resolution within a sample. MetaScope can be considered as an updated and expanded R translation of [PathoScope 2.0](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-2618-2-33), a Python-based metagenomic profiling package also created by our lab. 

A few improvements made in MetaScope over PathoScope include using the BAM file format instead of the SAM file format for significantly less disk space usage, removing all dependencies to NCBIâ€™s now defunct GI sequence annotations, and properly filtering reads that align to filter reference genomes. Functions to analyze host microbiome data are also planned to be added in future updates to the package.

## Installation

MetaScope requires R Version 4.1.

* This package is still under development; the most recent version can be accessed via github:

```
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly=TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("compbiomed/MetaScope")
```
